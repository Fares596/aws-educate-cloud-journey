# AWS Educate ‚Äì Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains a summary of the **Machine Learning Foundations** module completed on [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/).

The goal of the module is to introduce core machine learning (ML) concepts, clarify different ML types, and explore how ML is used in real-world applications. The course is theory-based with interactive slides and no coding.

## üìö Course Content

### 1. Machine Learning: A Subfield of AI

Machine Learning (ML) is a discipline within Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms capable of identifying patterns in data and making decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.  

It enables systems to **generalize from past data**, adapt over time, and support data-driven automation across a variety of domains.

### 2. Common Machine Learning Use Cases

- Image and speech recognition  
- Product recommendations  
- Fraud detection  

---

### 3. Three Main Types of Machine Learning

#### **Supervised Learning**
- Trained on labeled data (inputs and known outputs)
- Used for **classification** and **regression** tasks  
- Examples:  
  - Predicting house prices  
  - Spam email detection

#### **Unsupervised Learning**
- Works with **unlabeled** data  
- Finds hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering)
- Example: Market segmentation

#### **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- Agent learns by interacting with an environment  
- Receives **rewards** or **penalties** for actions  
- Common in robotics and game AI

### 4. Key ML Workflow Steps

- **Define the problem**
- **Collect and prepare data**
- **Choose and train a model**
- **Evaluate the model**
- **Improve ( = tune) and deploy the model**
